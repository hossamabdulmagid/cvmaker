            cookie allows the CV Maker system to identify a user as a registered

            the need of any manual action from the user. This cookie, in no way
            exposes any sensitive information.

            implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable
            law, CV Maker disclaims all warranties, express or implied,
            including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability
            or fitness for a particular purpose, or the warranty of

            warrant that the functions contained in the community or available
            through the community will be uninterrupted or error-free, that

            (and not CV Maker) assume the entire cost of all necessary
            servicing, repair, or correction. Applicable law may not allow the

            to you. Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to,
            negligence, shall CV Maker be liable for any special or
            consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability

            the possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the
            limitation or omission of liability for incidental or consequential
            damages, so the above limitation or omission may not apply to you.
            No advice or information, whether written or oral, obtained by you
            from CV Maker or from or through the community shall create any
            warranty not expressly stated in these terms of use. Notwithstanding
            the provisions of any applicable laws, it is hereby agreed that in
            no event shall the CV Maker’s total liability to you for all
            damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort
            (including, but not limited to, carelessness) or otherwise) exceed
            the amount paid by you, if any, for purchasing any materials,
            services or products.
